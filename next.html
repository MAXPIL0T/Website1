                <h2>UMass Amherst</h2>
                <p>
                    I am going to attend UMass Amherst next year.<br>
                    <br>
                    After starting the college search in spring of 2019 I knew that I wanted to go to a school that 
                    was bigger than Newton North, had good academics, and was close to home while not being directly 
                    in my backyard.<br>
                    <br>
                    The college application process was frustrating and long, but it all turned out 
                    well in the end!

                <p>
                    I don't know what the future hold <b>yet</b>.<br>
                    <br>
                    I am currently on the exploratory track for Education, but am still unsure of what exactly I want 
                    to do. I am considering Computer Science, Secondary Education, and History. I guess I will 
                    have to decide a some point, but I still have time.<br>
                    <br>
                    I am sure that I am well prepared for my UMass education because of my NNHS education.
